# When to use a Workflow vs a Team in Agno

Agno offers two powerful ways to build multi-agent systems: **Workflows** and **Teams**. Each is suited for different kinds of use-cases.

***

## Use a Workflow when:

You need **orchestrated, multi-step execution** with flexible control flow and a predictable outcome.

Workflows are ideal for:

* **Sequential processes** - Step-by-step agent executions with dependencies
* **Parallel execution** - Running independent tasks simultaneously
* **Conditional logic** - Dynamic routing based on content analysis
* **Quality assurance** - Iterative loops with end conditions
* **Complex pipelines** - Mixed components (agents, teams, functions) with branching
* **Structured processes** - Data transformation with predictable patterns

## Use an Agent Team when:

Your task requires reasoning, collaboration, or multi-tool decision-making.

Agent Teams are best for:

* Research and planning
* Tasks where agents divide responsibilities

## 💡 Pro Tip

> Think of **Workflows** as assembly lines for known tasks,
> and **Agent Teams** as collaborative task forces for solving open-ended problems.
